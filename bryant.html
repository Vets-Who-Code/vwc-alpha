      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I am a web developer, veteran, and emergency communications officer that
        lives in Nampa, Idaho. I am originally from the small town of Oak Ridge,
        North Carolina. I served in the Marine Corps as a Combat Engineer and in
        the Navy as an Aviation Ordnanceman. I have been married for 16 years.
        We have three dogs and two cats.

      <p>
        I enjoy fishing. There is nothing greater than being out on the water
        surrounded by nature. I recently took up fly fishing. It has been an
        extremely challenging and expensive new hobby. It definely takes a lot
        of patience, but is rewarding by helping you to clear your mind.

      <p>
        I also enjoy listening to metal music.I listen mostly to sludge, folk
        metal, doom/stoner metal, speed metal, and thrash metal. I also enjoy
        playing video games, watching MMA fights, and reading.
